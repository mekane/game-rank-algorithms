# Game Ranker

Inspired by Pub Meeple, I wanted to play around with the sorting algorithm for ranking a set of games.
It's an interesting problem to me because I'm really into board games and rankings, and also I'm a
software engineer with a computer science degree.

## Experiments

The `experiments/` directory has some code and scripts that I wrote to mess around
and try out some different sorting techniques.
